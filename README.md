# Multi-Document-Comparison
This repo is for my work at Synapxe to develop an application to compare among multiple medical reports.

The repo is incomplete and is still under development. The current version of the repo is only suitable for reference.

The current version of the repo contains the backbone structure to the backend development and model.

Further developments to the repo will include creating database framework and frontend development.
